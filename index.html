            <h4 data-text="COMPOUNDING">COMPOUNDING</h4>
            <p>Compounding is the process in which an asset's earnings, from either capital gains or interest, are
                reinvested to generate additional earnings over time. This growth, calculated using exponential
                functions,
                occurs because the investment will generate earnings from both its initial principal and the accumulated
                earnings from preceding periods. Compounding, therefore, differs from linear growth, where only the
                principal earns interest each period.<br><br>
                <strong>Understanding Compounding</strong><br>
                Compounding typically refers to the increasing value of an asset due to the interest earned on both a
                principal and accumulated interest. This phenomenon, which is a direct realization of the time value of
                money (TMV) concept, is also known as compound interest.

                Compound interest works on both assets and liabilities. While compounding boosts the value of an asset
                more
                rapidly, it can also increase the amount of money owed on a loan, as interest accumulates on the unpaid
                principal and previous interest charges.<br><br>
            <ol>
                <li>Compounding is the process whereby interest is credited to an existing principal amount as well as
                    to
                    interest already paid.</li><br>
                <li>Compounding can thus be construed as interest on interest—the effect of which is to magnify returns
                    to
                    interest over time, the so-called "miracle of compounding."</li><br>
                <li>When banks or financial institutions credit compound interest, they will use a compounding period
                    such
                    as annual, monthly, or daily.</li>

                <div class="faq-body">
                    <p>To start, you need to know how much money you have to invest upfront. Input this number in the
                        given box. Next, if you’d like to add more money to your investment at regular intervals, you
                        can choose to do so. Type in the amount you’d like to add and choose whether they will be
                        monthly or annual payments. Next, decide how many years you’d like to invest for. Will you be
                        making the regular payments for 5 years, 10 years or 25 years? You can either move the slider or
                        simply input the number of years in the provided box. Once you’re done putting money in your
                        investment, you can choose to remain invested for a longer time. This means that your interest
                        will continue to compound and your money will grow over time. When selecting the number of years
                        you'd like to stay invested for, it's important that it's more than the number of years that you
                        want to invest for. Again, you can either move the slider or input the number directly in the
                        provided box. If you have an understanding of how much money you would like at the end of the
                        investment term, you can check the graph on the right-hand side of the page. As you change the
                        rate of interest, either by shifting the slider or inputting numbers in the box, you’ll see how
                        much money you can expect to earn at the end of your investment term. This will give you a clear
                        indication of what is the best rate of interest for you to choose based on your investment
                        capabilities, the amount of time you want to invest for and the amount of money you hope to have
                        at the end of the investment.</p>

                <div class="faq-body">
                    <p>When it comes to investing, it’s always a good idea to choose an investment avenue that allows
                        you to enjoy compounded interest. This is the most efficient way to maximise your returns and
                        get the most out of your money. There are a number of investment opportunities today where you
                        can benefit from plans that compound interest at regular intervals. At the most basic level,
                        banks offer compound interest. The interest you earn every 6 months is added to your savings,
                        and for the next six month, you can earn interest on the new amount. But this is hardly enough
                        to help you achieve your financial goals. Mutual funds and Unit-Linked Insurance Plans (ULIPs)
                        are two of the most common investments that utilise compound interest formulae to grow your
                        money. Both investment avenues work in a similar fashion, with the main difference being that
                        ULIPs offer the additional benefit of life cover. Compound interest investment plans are
                        especially useful in planning your finances for your retirement.</p>

                    <div class="faq-body">
                        <p>The interest on a loan or deposit calculated based on the initial principal, and the
                            collective
                            interest from previous periods is called compound interest. It is basically 'interest earned
                            on
                            money that was previously earned as interest'. This allows your sum and interest to grow at
                            a
                            faster rate compared to the simple interest which is calculated only on the principal
                            amount.

                            The rate at which compound interest accumulates interest depends on the frequency - higher
                            the
                            number of compounding periods, higher will be the compound interest. For instance, if you
                            earn a
                            10% annual interest, a deposit of Rs 100 would gain you Rs 10 after a year. What happens the
                            following year? That’s where the compound interest comes in. You’ll earn interest on your
                            deposit, and you will also earn interest on the interest you just earned.</p>

                    <!-- faq answer -->
                    <div class="faq-body">
                        <p>If you make a sound investment, compound interest can help you to build your wealth over
                            time. But if your debt is subjected to compound interest, then it can cause financial
                            hardship if not planned. To understand how compound interest works, let us break down the
                            process of how your investment can compound better.

                            Compound Interest starts when your investment earns interest. At this point, the interest is
                            added to the initial investment amount. When it earns interest again, it will determine the
                            newly earned interest by calculating the initial capital invested and the earned interest.

                            As the size of the investment continues to grow, it will earn interest to the total
                            investment amount. This loop will continue allowing the investment to grow substantially
                            without any additional investment capital. With time, this cycle has potential for a
                            substantial growth of the original investment.</p>

                        <p>If you are concerned about not being able to save enough for your child's education or
                            retirement, then why not pick an investment avenue with compound interest? It has the
                            potential to grow your wealth and anyone can take advantage of the many benefits as listed
                            below:-</p><br>
                        <p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>You can earn interest on both the money you have saved and on the interest that money
                                earns. For instance, If you invest ₹ 5000 and receive 5% annual compound interest, at
                                the end of the year you will have ₹ 5,250 in your account. In your second year, interest
                                will be calculated on ₹ 5,250 and with every passing year, the amount accumulated will
                                have the interest paid on the balance and grow your wealth.</li>
                            <li>The longer money sits in a compound interest account, the more benefit you will reap
                                over the long term. A difference of even 1% in the interest rate will increase your
                                capital gains.</li>
                            <li>With inflation, the costs of services and goods increase gradually and causes the
                                purchasing power of currency to decline. Putting cash in investment avenues with
                                compound interest can mitigate the negative effects of inflation.</li>
                            <li>If you are unable to manage cash well, you won't be able to stay afloat. You need cash
                                to fund your daily needs and to plan for long term goals. Hence, investing money in
                                compounding interest accounts can be a good source for long-term cash management plan.
